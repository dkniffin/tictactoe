After cloning the repo, all you have to do to run the app is `main.rb`. That will start up the program. Once you tell it whether you want to play as X or O, it'll ask you for your move, which you can give with single number. 1 is the top left, 9 is the bottom right.

Testing
=======

To run the tests, simply run `test.rb`. It will run all possible games.
